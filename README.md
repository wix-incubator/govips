## A libvips library for Go
This package wraps the core functionality of [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) image processing library by exposing all image operations on first-class types in Go. Additionally, it exposes raw access to call operations directly, for forward compatibility.

How fast is libvips? See this: [Speed and Memory Use](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/wiki/Speed-and-memory-use)

This library was inspired primarily based on the C++ wrapper in libvips.

The intent for this is to enable developers to build extremely fast image processors in Go, which is suited well for concurrent requests.

Libvips is generally 4-8x faster than other graphics processors such as GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick.

## Requirements
- [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) 8+ (8.8.1+ recommended for GIF, PDF, SVG, HEIC support)
- C compatible compiler such as gcc 4.6+ or clang 3.0+
- Go 1.11+

## Installation
```bash
go get -u github.com/wix-playground/govips/vips
```

## Example usage
```go
image, err := NewImageFromFile("image.jpg")
if err != nil {
	return nil, err
}

// Resize an image with padding
return vips.Transform().
	PadStrategy(vips.ExtendBlack).
	Resize(1200, 1200).
	ApplyAndExport(image)
```
